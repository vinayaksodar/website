"Where do the smartest people in India go?-IIT's & Medical,Where do the smartest people in USA go?-wherever they want to." A very sad statement but when we look at it,it is actually true.We tried to think what was the root cause of this,and then it struck us Indians actually don't know a lot of the careers/jobs that exist and even if they do,they do not know what exactly people do in them.
  We are always blaming the education system in India but none of us do anything about it,here we present you an opportunity to be part of the single largest change India is about to see,together we can create a diverse India where everybody can see what exactly people do in various careers and choose one that they like.No child should have to pick a career simply because he has no other choice or because that is what others are doing.
 Our website trys to offer a platform where people can come and write how exactly life in there career is,how they started out and what they do on a daily basis kind of like a mini autobiography,all the posts are public but writers can post anonymously if they want.
 So whether you are a chef,ethical hacker,engineer,scientist,soldier,anyone please do come and write with us as we cannot do this without you. 
 Please do visit our webite,share this letter and most importantly write a post on our website.
                                                   -An initivative by students of IIT Madras.
